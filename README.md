# Grammar-Constrained Decoding for Structured NLP Tasks without Finetuning

---

## ðŸŒŸ New Implementation Compatible with HuggingFace Transformers

We provide an implementation of GCD that is compatible with the popular [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)! 

This new package, [Transformers-CFG](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/transformers-CFG), extends the capabilities of our Grammar-Constrained Decoding (GCD) approach by integrating seamlessly with the `Transformers` library. It offers:

- **Easy Integration:** Quickly combine the power of GCD with any model listed in the `transformers` library with just few lines of code!
- **Enhanced Performance:** Leverage the GCD technique for more efficient and accurate generation.
- **Friendly Interface:** Implemented with the EBNF grammar interface, making it accessible for both beginners and experts.

Get started with Transformers-CFG [here](https://github.com/Saibo-creator/transformers-CFG).

## 2. Environment Setup

With the repository cloned, we recommend creating a new [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n GCD python=3.9
conda activate GCD
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiments

- [Download datasets, grammars and models](docs/download_data.md)
- [Build task-specific grammars](https://github.com/Saibo-creator/GF_helper)
- [Windows-specific setting](docs/windows.md)
- [Running the experiments](docs/run_experiments.md)
